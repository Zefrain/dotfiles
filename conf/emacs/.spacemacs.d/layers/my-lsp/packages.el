;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `my-lsp-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `my-lsp/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `my-lsp/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `my-lsp/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

(defconst my-lsp-packages
          '(cquery company-lsp ))
;;; packages.el ends here
(defun my-lsp/init-cquery()
  (use-package cquery
    :defer t
    :init
    (setq cquery-executable "/usr/local/bin/cquery")))

(defun my-lsp/post-init-company-lsp()
  (use-package company-lsp
    :defer t
    :init
    (setq company-quickhelp-delay 0)
    ;; Language servers have better idea filtering and sorting,
    ;; don't filter results on the client side.
    (setq company-transformers nil
          company-lsp-async t
          company-lsp-cache-candidates nil)
    (spacemacs|add-company-backends :backends company-lsp :modes c-mode c++-mode python-mode go-mode)
